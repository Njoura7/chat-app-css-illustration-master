## Overview

In this project I learned how to use the "z-index" property and the "animation" property with @keyframes and I am really looking forward to know more about them especially they are largely supported and they can be rerally usefull in many situations. I did the background shapes using divs, which is not the best for responsive design but I tried to play with the medias, I didn't find the need to use SVGs, but if there is a better way to do it or there any other suggestion that would apprecited
any feedback is appreciated too.
Good coding journey for all ;)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	z-index: ;
}
.proud-of-this-css {
	animation: name duration animation-timing-function;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to work more and discover the world of SVG and become familiar with it even though it is not needed in this project but it might be really useful in other projects especially that it is supported by most of the browesers and it can shorten many tasks.
Also I need to start working with a preprocessor (I ve already chosen SASS) , I'll also try to use the BEM methodology and the utility classes which will definitely provide a CLEAR, ORGANIZED, and SCALABLE code
